Basic Cryptography PHP

So this thing is simply a page that allows you to input some text and choose a variety of different ciphers or a couple of conversions to the text.

The ciphers used are pretty standard "known" ciphers, but "D Scramble" is one I made up myself.

This is also my first git thing, so go easy on it.
